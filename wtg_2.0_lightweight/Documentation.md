# WTG 2.0 Lightweight Documentation

## Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2025-10-30

## Version History

### Version 1.0.6 (2025-10-30)
**Feature: Automatic Leading Space Injection**

**New Feature Added**:
A new utility function `ensureLeadingSpace()` has been added to automatically inject a leading space at the beginning of action text if one isn't already present.

**Purpose**:
- Ensures consistent formatting of AI responses in scenarios
- Prevents formatting issues when actions don't naturally start with a space
- Ensures space is preserved after system messages and commands on following turns
- Applied to ALL output paths (all return statements)

**Implementation**:
- **Function Location**: `library copy.js` (end of file, lines 949-967)
- **Function Name**: `ensureLeadingSpace(actionText)`
- **Integration Points**: `output copy.js` 
  - Line ~16: Applied when WTG is disabled
  - Line ~82: Applied to initial settime system message
  - Line ~268: Applied to final output (before return)
- **Logic**: 
  - Checks if input string is valid (non-null, non-empty, string type)
  - Returns unchanged if text already starts with space
  - Prepends single space character if not present

**Files Modified**:
- `library copy.js`: Added ensureLeadingSpace() function
- `output copy.js`: Integrated function call in all output return paths

**Impact**:
- All AI responses now consistently start with a leading space
- Prevents formatting inconsistencies after system messages and commands
- Ensures proper spacing on turns following command execution
- Guarantees consistent formatting across all output paths

### Version 1.0.5 (2025-10-29)
**Bug Fix: Back-to-Back Commands Time Addition**

**Issue Fixed**:
When using two commands back-to-back (e.g., `[sleep]` followed by `[advance]`), the second command was not properly adding time to the first command's result. This was the same bug that affected autocards+wtg 2.0.

**Root Cause**:
In `library.js` (line 538), the regex pattern had a `$` anchor at the end that prevented matching timestamp markers with trailing characters (like `. `).

**Solution Implemented**:
Removed the `$` anchor from the regex pattern to allow matching timestamp markers anywhere in the text.

**Files Modified**:
- `library copy.js`: Fixed regex in `getLastTurnTimeAndChars()` function (line 538)

**Impact**:
- Back-to-back commands now properly accumulate time
- Multiple commands in sequence maintain accurate time tracking

**Backup Created**: `Backup/wtg_2.0_lightweight_1.0.5_back_to_back_command_fix_2025-10-29/`

### Version 1.0.4 (2025-10-29)
**Bug Fix: Missing isLightweightMode Function**

**Issue Fixed**:
The `isLightweightMode()` function was being called in `output.js` (line 15) and `input.js` (line 15) but was not defined in `library.js`, causing a runtime error: "isLightweightMode is not defined at modifier (<isolated-vm>:1845:3)".

**Root Cause**:
The function was missing from the library file. While `wtg_2.0_scenario` had the function defined, it was accidentally omitted from `wtg_2.0` and `wtg_2.0_lightweight` library files during development.

**Solution Implemented**:
Added the missing `isLightweightMode()` function to `library.js`:
```javascript
/**
 * Check if we're in lightweight mode
 * @returns {boolean} True if in lightweight mode
 */
function isLightweightMode() {
  return state.wtgMode === 'lightweight';
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `library.js`: Added missing `isLightweightMode()` function after descriptiveMap definition (lines 16-22)

**Impact**:
- Eliminates runtime error when output or input hooks execute
- Allows proper mode detection for WTG features
- Fixes crashes on scenario start

**Backup Created**: `Backup/wtg_2.0_lightweight_1.0.4_missing_function_fix_2025-10-29/`

### Version 1.0.3 (2025-10-14)
**Feature: Automatic Storycard [settime] Detection at Scenario Start**

**New Features**:
1. **Storycard [settime] Processing**: When a scenario first starts, the system now scans all storycards for `[settime]` commands. If found, the command is automatically processed to set the starting date and time, allowing the AI to immediately begin generating responses without showing the opening prompt.

2. **Command Removal**: After processing a `[settime]` command from a storycard, the command is automatically removed from the storycard entry to keep the story clean.

**How It Works**:
- At scenario start (action count ≤ 1), all storycards are scanned for `[settime date time]` commands
- Format: `[settime mm/dd/year time AD]` or `[settime mm/dd/year time BC]` (e.g., `[settime 08/15/2024 3:30 pm AD]`, `[settime 03/15/44 9:00 am BC]`, or `[settime 08/15/2024 3:30 pm]` to default to AD)
- Supports various date separators: `/`, `-`, `.`
- Supports 1-6 digit years, including single-digit years
- Time formats: `3:30 pm`, `3 pm`, `15:30`, etc.
- Once found and processed, the command is removed from the storycard
- The opening prompt is skipped, and the AI generates the first response immediately

**Use Case**:
This feature is perfect for scenarios where you want to pre-configure the starting time without requiring players to manually enter a `[settime]` command. Simply add `[settime 01/15/2025 8:00 am]` to any storycard entry in your scenario, and players can start playing immediately.

**Example**:
Create a storycard with entry:
```
[settime 12/25/2024 6:00 am]
It's Christmas morning in Victorian London...
```

When the scenario starts, the time is automatically set to December 25, 2024 at 6:00 AM, and the AI begins the story without showing the setup prompt.

**Files Modified**:
- `output copy.js`: Added storycard scanning and [settime] processing logic at scenario start

### Version 1.0.2 (2025-10-08)
**Bug Fix: Storycard Update and System Message Format (Timestamp Injection Solution)**

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Storycard Not Updating**: User commands ([sleep], [advance], [settime], [reset]) would update `state.currentDate` and `state.currentTime`, but the "Current Date and Time" storycard wouldn't update to reflect the changes.

2. **Bracketed Messages Ignored by AI**: System messages like `[Advanced 2 hours. New date/time: 08/08/2037 8:01 AM.]` were being ignored by the AI because they looked like user commands in brackets.

3. **Sleep Command Time Initialization**: When using `[sleep]` with Unknown time, the command wasn't properly initializing `startingTime`.

**Solution Implemented**:
Inject the turn time marker `[[00y00m00d06h01n00s]]` directly into system messages, reusing the existing timestamp detection mechanism:

1. **Input Hook**: Adds `[[turntime]]` marker to system messages (e.g., `[SYSTEM] You go to sleep... [[00y00m01d00h00n00s]]`)
2. **Context Hook**: Detects `[[turntime]]` in the last action and uses it directly without adding character-based time
3. **Changed Format**: System messages now use `[SYSTEM]` prefix instead of wrapping entire message in brackets

**Files Modified**:
- `input copy.js`: Added `[[turntime]]` markers to all command system messages, updated message format to `[SYSTEM]`
- `context copy.js`: Added check to use `[[turntime]]` from last action directly when present
- `output copy.js`: Cleaned up unnecessary pending change logic

**Backup Created**: `Backup/wtg_2.0_lightweight_storycard_update_fix_2025-10-08/`

### Version 1.0.1 (2025-10-08)
**Bug Fix: [sleep] Command Time Initialization**

**Issue**: When using the `[sleep]` command with an Unknown time, the command would set `state.currentTime` to "8:00 AM" but not update `state.startingTime`. This caused subsequent time calculations to fail because `computeCurrent()` would still use `startingTime='Unknown'` and return Unknown time.

**Fix**: Modified the `[sleep]` command to properly initialize time when transitioning from Unknown:
- Reset `state.turnTime` to zero before adding the sleep duration
- Set `state.startingTime` to "8:00 AM" when time is Unknown
- Allow `computeCurrent()` to calculate the correct time based on the new starting time
- This ensures future `[advance]` commands work correctly after using `[sleep]`

**Files Modified**:
- `input copy.js` (lines 34-43): Updated [sleep] command to initialize startingTime

**Backup Created**: `Backup/wtg_2.0_lightweight_sleep_advance_fix_2025-10-08/`

### Version 1.0.0 (2025-10-01)
Initial release of WTG 2.0 Lightweight

## Overview
WTG 2.0 Lightweight is a streamlined version of the World Time Generator that focuses exclusively on core time tracking and timestamp injection. This version removes all AI prompt injections, entity generation, and configuration options to provide a simple, efficient time tracking system.

## Purpose
This lightweight version is designed for users who want:
- Simple time tracking without complexity
- Automatic timestamp injection into storycards
- No AI prompt interference
- Minimal overhead and maximum performance
- Predictable, consistent behavior

## Core Features

### 1. Time Tracking
- **Turn Time**: Tracks elapsed time in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- **Current Date and Time**: Maintains current in-story date and time
- **Fixed Rate**: Time advances at 1 minute per 700 characters (not configurable)
- **Turn Time Format**: Internal format `00y00m00d00h00n00s` for precision

### 2. Timestamp Injection
- **Automatic**: All storycards receive timestamps when first mentioned
- **Discovery Verbs**:
  - Characters: "Met on [date] [time]"
  - Locations: "Visited [date] [time]"
  - Others: "Discovered on [date] [time]"
- **No Manual Intervention**: Timestamps are added automatically

### 3. Commands
All commands are enclosed in brackets `[command]`:

#### [settime mm/dd/year time AD]
Set the starting date, era, and time for your adventure.
- **Format**: `[settime 06/15/2023 3:30 PM AD]`, `[settime 03/15/44 9:00 AM BC]`
- **Date**: mm/dd/year or dd/mm/year (auto-detected), with 1-6 digit years
- **Year flow**: BC years count down as time advances; AD years count up
- **Era**: Optional `BC` or `AD` (`CE` is also accepted as an AD alias, and `BCE` as a BC alias); if omitted, it defaults to `AD`
- **Time**: 12-hour format (3:30 PM) or 24-hour format (15:30)
- **Effect**: Resets turn time to zero and updates all existing timestamps

#### [advance N unit]
Manually advance time by a specified amount.
- **Format**: `[advance 5 hours]`, `[advance 2 days]`, `[advance 3 months]`
- **Units**: hours, days, months, years
- **Effect**: Advances time immediately

#### [reset]
Reset date and time to the most recent mention in story history.
- **Format**: `[reset]`
- **Effect**: Scans history for date/time mentions and resets to most recent

#### [sleep]
Natural language command to sleep to the next morning.
- **Format**: Include "end the day" in your action
- **Effect**: Sleep 6-9 hours with random minutes, wake up at 8:00 AM if next day

### 4. Current Date and Time Storycard
Special system storycard that displays:
```
Starting date: 06/15/2023
Starting time: 8:00 AM
Current date: 06/15/2023
Current time: 10:45 AM
Turn time: 00y00m00d02h45n00s
```

### 5. WTG Data Storycard (Adventure Erasing Detection)
Internal system storycard that tracks turn data for detecting when users jump back in adventure history:
- Stores action text and timestamp for each turn
- Used to detect adventure erasing (when action text doesn't match expected)
- Automatically cleans up future turn data when time jumps backward
- Not included in AI context (internal use only)

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Copy all 4 files into your AI Dungeon shared library
2. Start a new adventure or continue an existing one
3. Use `[settime 06/15/2023 8:00 AM AD]` to set your starting date, era, and time (or omit the era to default to AD)

### During Adventure
- Time automatically advances based on story length
- Timestamps are automatically added to all storycards
- Use commands as needed to adjust time
- Check "Current Date and Time" storycard to see current time

### Best Practices
- Set a starting time at the beginning of your adventure
- Use [advance] for intentional time jumps (travel, waiting)
- Use "[sleep]" when your character sleeps
- Use [reset] if time gets out of sync with story

## Technical Details

### Time Calculation
- **Base Rate**: 1 minute per 700 characters
- **Turn Time Storage**: Cumulative time since starting point
- **History Scanning**: Looks for `[[turntime]]` markers in history
- **Character Counting**: Counts characters between turn time markers

### Timestamp Format
- **Date**: mm/dd/year with optional era (e.g., 06/15/2023 AD or 03/15/44 BC)
- **Time**: hh:mm AM/PM (e.g., 3:45 PM)
- **Combined**: "Met on 03/15/44 BC 9:45 PM"

### System Storycards
- **WTG Data**: Stores simplified turn data for adventure erasing detection (not included in context)
- **Current Date and Time**: Displays current date/time and turn time

### Adventure Erasing Detection
- When user jumps back in history, the system detects action text mismatch
- Automatically cleans up turn data with timestamps from the "future"
- Removes timestamps from storycards that are now in the future
- Maintains data integrity when navigating adventure history
